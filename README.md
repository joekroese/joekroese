Hi! I'm Joe (or often Jo and sometimes Jobi). I'm half 🇳🇱 but more 🇬🇧.

🔨 For work:

1. 🧑‍💻 I am a data scientist at [Citizense](https://www.citizense.org/) where I take fancy techniques from data science and apply them to researching public health, social justice and the environment. I *love* being an academic outside academia.
1. 🗂️ I'm researching with [The Radical Data Project](https://radicaldata.org), a place where I reimagine how data science can work for citizens and communities instead of just selling us more shoes.
1. 🎵I make live coded electronic music as [Jobi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5hqk9xS8vt_jmbVONjQjg).

✨ Side projects:
- 🧠 I’m building [tiddlyroam](https://tiddlyroam.org), a tool to easily create a personal wiki that emphasises the connections between ideas.
- 🧮 I'm writing [tidymrp](https://tidymrp.com), an R package to make it easier to run MRP analyses.

🌱 I’m currently learning about: deliberate practice, the Tao, MRP, note-taking and Bayesian statistics.

💬 Ask me: about the joy of cold water swimming, being a freelance data scientist or why artists should write code and why coders should make art.

😄 Pronouns: they/them.
